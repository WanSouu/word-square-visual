# Word square
A word square is a type of acrostic. It consists of a set of words written out in a square grid, such that the same words can be read both horizontally and vertically. The number of words, which is equal to the number of letters in each word, is known as the "order" of the square. For example, this is an order 5 square:
```
H E A R T
E M B E R
A B U S E
R E S I N
T R E N D
```
